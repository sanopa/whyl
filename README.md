  What have you learned? Whyl is an iOS app that allows you to keep track of one interesting thing you have learned each day. Inspired by Reddit, we want everybody to enjoy learning something new all the time.

  You will receive daily notifications at a time of your choice inviting you to add something to your collection of knowledge (if you allow notifications). Fill in at least one of title, description and link, and you are good to go. In case you do not encounter anything that captures your interest, click on the lightbulb to get some hot facts that other people have shared from /r/todayilearned! Add it to your history once you find something worth saving.

  In your history of learned facts, the first thing you see on top is a random fact that you have learned some time in the past for you to rediscover. If you happen to forget the specifics of a fact that you have recorded with Whyl, you can also search for it by its title and refresh your memory.

  Enjoy your learning adventures!
